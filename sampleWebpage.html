    <h1>The Calvin and Hobbes Fan Club</h1>
    <p><b>Welcome to the unofficial Calvin and Hobbes fan page!</b> Here you will find information and details of all things Calvin and Hobbes, the hit comic series by Bill Watterson. Continue reading below if you want to find out more about the characters of the comic, the general publication history of the comic, as well as other informative topics related to Calvin and Hobbes!</p>
    <h2>A brief introduction of the main characters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><mark><i>Calvin</i></mark></li>
        <p>Calvin is the main protagonist of the series. A six year old boy with an overactive imagination and <em>a very strong mischievous streak</em>, he often goes on adventures with his pal <i>Hobbes</i>, which usually end with Calvin facing consequences in some way. Perhaps due to his overactive imagination, he would often monolgue on topics ranging from philosophy to paleontology to epistemology, which, coupled with his child-like behavior and mannerisms, results in a character duality that has become one of the defining traits of the comic.</p>
        <li><mark><i>Hobbes</i></mark></li>
        <p>Hobbes is the secondary protagonist of the series. A stuffed tiger brought to life by Calvin's imagination, he often accompanies Calvin across his many adventures and is the primary recipient to his monologues. Snarky and inquisitive, Hobbes is often used as a foil to Calvin's actions and monologues, poking holes in his statements and disrupting his adventures in some way. <sup><i>although that is not always the case</i></sup></p>

    <h3>A brief timeline of the comic</h3>
    <p>Calvin and Hobbes was first published on <b>November 18, 1985</b>, and achieved very early success. By 1986, the comic strip was published in over 250 newspapers nationwide and even saw success overseas as it was translated into several different languages and became widely circulated. The popularity of the strip came at a cost as Watterson was forced into several disputes over his syndicate editors over licensing agreements due to his reluctance to cede creative control of his characters. These disputes led to him taking a break from 1991 to 1992, during which newspapers reran old Calvin and Hobbes strips. Following his return, Watterson would create more strips until a 2nd break in 1994 from April to December. Following his return, he declared that the comic strip would end, and the last strip was published on December 31, 1995. </p>
